## the sketch drawing is really hard because I have to think of the coordinates for every vertex. Some of my shape could not be described by quad or rectanges or circles, so I have to use StartShape function to do that.
The Myshape function made more sense before I start. Now I can use it to form complex shape, and multiply it and put it in different positions.
I'm proud that I'm now more familiar with basic functions, and are able to draw coordinates using less time
